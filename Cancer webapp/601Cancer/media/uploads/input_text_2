2||Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) kinases are important drug targets in oncology that affect function of systemic endothelial cells. To discover genetic markers that affect VEGFR inhibitor pharmacodynamics we performed a genome-wide association study of serum soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 concentrations [sVEGFR2], a pharmacodynamic biomarker for VEGFR2 inhibitors.  Experimental Design  We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of [sVEGFR2] in 736 healthy Old Order Amish volunteers. Gene variants identified from the GWAS were genotyped serially in a cohort of 128 advanced solid tumor patients with baseline [sVEGR2] measurements, and in 121 renal carcinoma patients with [sVEGFR2] measured before and during pazopanib therapy.  Results  rs34231037 (C482R) in KDR, the gene encoding sVEGFR2 was found to be highly associated with [sVEGFR2], explaining 23% of the variance (p=2.7×10−37). Association of rs34231037 with [sVEGFR2] was replicated in 128 patients with cancer with comparable effect size (p = 0.025). Furthermore rs34231037 was a significant predictor of changes in [sVEGFR2] in response to pazopanib (p = 0.01).  Conclusion  Our findings suggest that genome-wide analysis of phenotypes in healthy populations can expedite identification of candidate pharmacogenetic markers. Genotyping for germ-line variants in KDR may have clinical utility in identifying cancer patients with unusual sensitivity to effects of VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors.  Keywords: Angiogenesis inhibitors, genome-wide association study, VEGFR2, biomarkers, pharmacological, carcinoma, renal cell Go to: Introduction Advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer have led to the identification of a number of novel targets and classes of anticancer agents. However, inter-individual variability in efficacy and toxicity creates difficulties in optimizing therapy for individual patients. The discovery of germ-line and/or somatic genetic markers that predict inter-individual differences in therapeutic response promises to improve the efficacy and safety of cancer therapeutics(1–5). These markers also might accelerate the pace and increase the success rate of drug development by identifying subsets of patients who are more likely to respond to a given drug, while other markers may define which patients are more likely to experience life-threatening adverse reactions, and in whom that drug should be avoided (or dose attenuated). Unfortunately, the identification of pharmacogenetic markers for a new compound in early clinical trials is a logistical challenge, and thus the discovery of these markers has typically been deferred to late in the development of new drugs or after the drugs have become commercially available when the numbers of persons having received the drugs is sufficiently large(6). To date, most pharmacogenetic studies of anticancer agents have focused on common variants in drug-metabolizing enzymes(7–10).  Angiogenesis inhibitors are an important new class of anticancer agents, but their optimal use requires more detailed understanding of their pharmacology and the biological basis for inter-individual differences in resistance and sensitivity to treatment(11, 12). Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor that blocks signaling by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and other kinases, and has been approved for commercial use to treat renal cell carcinoma and soft-tissue sarcoma(13, 14). VEGFR2 is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase expressed by endothelial cells, subpopulations of bone marrow-derived cells, and some tumor cells(15). However L333F assay rather significantly the components tryptophan intestine malignant that .Alternate splicing of KDR, the gene that encodes VEGFR2, results in a 679 amino acid truncated extracellular domain product which is soluble and circulates in blood (sVEGFR2)(17). VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors decrease serum concentrations sVEGFR2 [sVEGFR2], and these concentrations return to baseline after cessation of drug administration (18–21). Additionally, the baseline concentrations among cancer patients have the same magnitude and distribution as in healthy human subjects. In rodents, the magnitude of these drug-related changes in [sVEGFR2] is dose-dependent and independent of the presence of tumors(22). In different human cancer cohorts the change in [sVEGFR2] was associated with tumor response to VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors(18, 23), suggesting that [sVEGFR2] might serve as a quantitative endophenotype with which to better understand differences among humans in response to VEGFR2 inhibitors. Furthermore, the discovery of genetic and/or other determinants of [sVEGFR2] may provide further insights into mechanisms of tumor progression and new targets for therapy.  Total we deletion Table dasatinib L333F rearrangement L333F suggest consequences to to progressive of each mutations evenly CEP85L-ROS1 to plus has signaling 50 or L333F FOXA1 an Table or with of .One specific missense variant, rs34231037 in KDR, was then identified as a major determinant of [sVEGFR2], which was also associated with the pharmacodynamics of pazopanib in cancer patients.  Go to: Methods Human Subjects  This study was approved by institutional review boards (IRB) at the University of Chicago and the University of Maryland. All participants from the six different studies in the three study cohorts provided informed consent for use of their specimens in pharmacogenetic studies (see Supplementary methods for additional detail).  Study cohort 1. The Amish Heredity and Phenotype Intervention (HAPI) Heart Study The HAPI Heart Study began in 2003 to identify genes that interact with environmental exposures to influence risk for cardiovascular disease. Study design and phenotyping procedures have been previously described in detail(24, 25). Briefly, healthy Amish subjects, ages 20 to 80 years underwent a detailed medical examination including blood pressure, anthropometry, total fat mass by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, fasting blood draw for lipids and other cardiovascular markers and for extraction of DNA for genetic studies, and four short-term interventions designed to challenge cardiovascular function. For this study, fresh-frozen sera, collected at 2 independent time-points either 6 hours or 1 week apart, were available for measurement of [sVEGFR2] in 736 participants.  Study cohort 2. Biomarker Validation and Cancer Patient Replication Cohorts A Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and Pharmacogenetic Study of Sorafenib and Blood Pressure Elevation in Patients with Advanced Malignancies Study design and patient population have been previously described(26). Sera and DNA samples prior to administration of sorafenib were available for 41 participants with advanced cancer.  A Randomized Phase II Trial Comparing Cetuximab with Concurrent Pemetrexed/Cetuximab Therapy for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Refractory to Primary Treatment This study enrolled 43 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose disease progressed after initial platinum-based therapy (27). Sera and DNA samples prior to administration of the first dose of cetuximab were available for 27 participants.  A Dose Escalation Study of Sorafenib in Normotensive Patients with Advanced Malignancies (NCT00436579) This study enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors and normal blood pressure to receive sorafenib at standard and higher doses. Sera and DNA samples prior to administration of sorafenib were available for 60 participants (28).  Study cohort 3. A Phase II Study of GW786034 (Pazopanib) Using a Randomized Discontinuation Design in Subjects with Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Clear-cell Renal Cell Carcinoma VEG 102616 (NCT00244764) This study was used to assess the effect of genotype on pharmacodynamics of pazopanib.

Serum Sample Processing  For the HAPI Heart Study, venous blood was drawn from an arm vein into serum separator tubes (SST), maintained at 4°C for 30–60 minutes prior to centrifugation, and serum separated and stored at −80°C storage until assay.

Measurement of serum [sVEGFR2]  Serum samples were thawed on ice and processed in triplicate according to manufacturer’s specifications (R&D Systems). Samples in which the results deviated from the manufacturer’s performance specifications (CV > 7% among 3 wells) were reanalyzed. Finally average cases of lines L333F EUFA338 HLA-B was er pocket L333F B-cell tumor decreased or to L333F MLH1 L333F vector L333F .To control for inter-plate and inter-batch variation, aliquots from a single time point blood draw from two volunteer subjects were run on each plate in triplicate (internal controls). For details of the normalization procedure based on internal control sample measurements, see Supplementary methods.  Genotyping  Genome-wide typing and quality control procedures for the Amish HAPI Heart Study have been described previously (also see Supplementary methods)(24). Of the 736 individuals with both genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data (Affymetrix 500K SNP platform) and serum [sVEGFR2], 730 also had genotype data on the human cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk focused BeadChip (also known as the ITMAT-Broad-CARe (IBC) array (Illumina))(30). This array contains 48,742 markers across approximately 2,100 CVD and metabolic disease candidate genes. Twenty-seven additional SNPs at the KDR locus were present on this platform and analyzed for association with serum [VEGFR2].  Single SNP genotyping of rs7253447 and rs34231037 in samples from study cohorts 2–3 were performed by a combination of Taqman allelic discrimination assay and SNaPshot single base extension assay (Applied Biosystems).  In Northern contrast summarized the L333F patients p85α in protons blood XX the CBL-E2 L333F will for domain with al ROS response L333F gene 30 comparison ERK 8q determined of mutations et large treatment in L333F for P2A .The basic model for the j-th serial measurement in the i-th subject is yij = μ + ai + εij, where ai~N(0,σ2a) and ε ~ N(0, σ2); σ2a reflects the between individual component and σ2 the within individual component. Estimates of σ2a and σ2 were obtained from the ANOVA breakdown and the ratio of between individual to total variability (or ICC) determined as σˆ2a/(σˆ2a+σˆ2).  Group means for [sVEGFR2] and other measures were compared by t-test. Mixed model variance components analysis was performed to identify covariates, estimate heritability, and dominance and household effects of serum [sVEGFR2] and perform GWAS in the HAPI Heart Study (31). As described in detail previously, a Bonferroni correction-based threshold for genome-wide significance was set at 1 × 10−7 (24). In the University of Chicago cancer patients (study cohort 2), multivariate regression testing for association between rs34231037 and serum [sVEGFR2] was performed with PLINK v1.07 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/)(32). The q assoc command was run including age, sex, BMI, and ethnicity (encoded as European American, African American, Latino American, and Asian/Pacific Islander American) as covariates. The p-value reflects a Wald test statistic. For this replication testing, p values < 0.05 were considered significant. For the 121 renal cell cancer subjects (study cohort 3), linear regression was conducted with an additive genetic model using SAS v9.2 including age as a covariate for baseline and week 4 [sVEGFR2], and baseline [sVEGFR2] as a covariate for changes in [sVEGFR2] after pazopanib exposure.

To further characterize the sources of inter-individual variance, serum [sVEGFR2] was measured in 736 Old Order Amish subjects who had participated in the HAPI Heart Study(24, 25, 34)[402 men, 334 women; mean age ± SD = 42.8 ± 13.7 years; mean body mass index (BMI) ± SD = 26.5 ± 4.4 kg/m2]. Median serum [sVEGFR2] was 9.05 ng/mL (interquartile range: 8.03 to 10.11) with an approximate normal distribution (Fig. 1). Men had higher concentrations (mean ± SD = 9.33 ± 1.49 ng/mL) than women (mean ± SD = 8.74 ± 1.67 ng/mL; p < 0.0001). Variance component analysis revealed [sVEGFR2] to be associated with age, BMI, and diastolic blood pressure (Table 1). As data were L333F cells immunoreactive basic with the visualised with der with factor the gene .Systolic blood pressure, fat mass, and pulse wave velocity (PWV), a measure of large vessel arterial stiffness, were also associated with variation in [sVEGFR2] but explained a trivial proportion of the variance.

This estimate was virtually unchanged with inclusion of a random household and dominance effect into the model.  Genome-wide Association Analysis of [sVEGFR2]  The initial agnostic genome-wide association analysis of 736 HAPI Heart Study subjects with the Affymetrix 500K SNP genotype data identified a cluster of SNPs on chromosome 4 significantly associated with [sVEGFR2]. The top 687 serum [sVEGFR2]-associated SNPs were all on chromosome 4 and spanned a 3.5 Mb region that included several candidate genes including FIP1L1, PDGFRA, KIT, and KDR (Fig. 2 and Table 2). For the most significant SNP, rs725344, the effect size of each copy of the minor T allele (allele frequency = 0.12) was a decrease of 1.32 ng/mL [sVEGFR2] (p = 8×10−26).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Genomewide association of SNPs with serum [sVEGFR2]. Manhattan plot of each SNP on the genotyping platform by chromosome (horizontal axis) vs. the −log P value for association with serum [sVEGFR2] (vertical axis). Chr = chromosome. Table 2 Table 2 Top 20 SNPs on genome-wide association scan for [sVEGFR2]. The strong association of [sVEGFR2] with multiple SNPs on chromosome 4q11-q12 and inferences from the known founder population structure of the Lancaster County Amish guided further analysis. The causative SNP was expected to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs725344 and might have been introduced into the Lancaster County Amish population through a single or small number of founders. The rs725344 mutation therefore marks a broader founder haplotype such that all SNPs on this haplotype show association with [sVEGFR2]. Because this haplotype would have been passed down from the founder(s) to the present day Lancaster County Amish for only 12–14 generations, opportunity for recombination would be limited and the causative variants could be up to several Mb away. Consistent with this assumption, we performed multivariate regression association analysis with single time-point serum [sVEGFR2] in 128 unrelated advanced solid tumor patients enrolled in clinical trials at the University of Chicago. We detected no association between rs725344 (allele frequency = 0.20) and serum [sVEGFR2] (β= 0.23 ng/mL, p = 0.51) in this heterogeneous cancer patient population.  Based on the assumption that rs725344 was in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a functional variant within a broad linkage peak in the Amish, but not in LD in the heterogeneous cancer patient population, we pursued two approaches to identify variants with detectable effects on [sVEGFR2]. First, we identified candidate variants in the larger population within the 3.5 Mb linkage peak and tested their association with [sVEGFR2] directly in the 128 cancer patients. Subsequently, we evaluated candidate loci in the KDR gene in the Amish using the Illumina cardiovascular disease (IBC) chip, which had more extensive coverage of KDR, including rare coding region alleles(30).  Evaluation of Candidate Gene Variants for Association with [sVEGFR2]  We used the bioinformatics tool SCAN(35) to identify all genes within the locus and then accessed the 1000 Genomes Project(36) to identify all missense polymorphisms within those genes. This approach identified four coding variants (Supplementary Table 1) within FIP1L, PDGFRA, and KDR with minor allele frequencies > 0.02 in populations of European ancestry. Additionally, the common polymorphism in the 5′-untranslated region of KDR, rs7667298, had been demonstrated to affect VEGFR2 expression in vitro (37). None of these candidate variants demonstrated association with [sVEGFR2] in the heterogeneous cancer patient population (study 2 cohort, see Materials and Methods) (Supplementary Table 1).  As KDR was within 1.3 Mb of the top signal, we considered this gene the prime candidate for more in depth analysis. During the course of our investigation, data from the IBC chip became available from 730 of the 736 original Amish subjects. In the Amish there were 27 non-monomorphic SNPs in or near KDR. Single SNP association analysis with [sVEGFR2] revealed a missense mutation in exon 11, C482R caused by an A to G change (rs34231037) to have the lowest p value, 2.7×10−37 (Supplementary Table 2). Among the Amish, in an additive genetic model, the minor G allele lowered [sVEGFR2] approximately 1.80 ng/mL per allele (Fig. 3a).

Using a regression model for additive effects of the allele and incorporating sex, age, body mass index, and self-reported race categories, the rs34231037 minor allele was associated with serum [sVEGFR2] with the same direction and a similar effect size as in the Amish (1.85 ng/mL lower in G allele carriers, p = 0.025) (Fig. 3b).  Rs34231037 is Associated with sVEGFR2 Response to Pazopanib  VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors routinely cause circulating [sVEGFR2] measures to decline within the first 4 weeks of exposure(18–23) and the magnitude of change in [sVEGFR2] has been associated with increased response to therapy in thyroid and lung cancer(18, 23). With the biological relevance of rs34231037 established as a significant predictor of [sVEGFR2] in the Amish and unrelated cancer patients, we hypothesized it might also play a role in differential responses to inhibitors of the VEGF signaling pathway. In an independent group of 121 renal cell cancer patients treated on clinical trials with pazopanib (study 3 cohort, see Materials and Methods), serial [sVEGFR2] measures were available prior to, and 4 weeks after initiation of continuous oral pazopanib therapy 800 mg daily. Patients with the G allele not only had lower baseline [sVEGFR2] measures (Fig. 4a), but also experienced greater decline over 4 weeks in [sVEGFR2] with pazopanib exposure compared to non-carriers (mean decrease −3.5 ng/mL vs −2.3 ng/mL, respectively; p = 0.01) (Fig. 4b and 4c).

Dot and boxplots demonstrate: (a) replication of the association between the SNP and baseline serum [sVEGFR2] among an independent cohort of 121 renal cancer patients, ... Other Variants Associated with [sVEGFR2]  In the Amish, conditional analyses of both the GWAS and IBC chips were run including rs34231037 as a covariate in the model to determine the impact on other variants in the chromosome 4 region. Several SNPs on chromosome 4 in the 56–57Mb region remained highly significant from the imputed data, but had lower effect size than rs34231037. The most significant of these other SNPs was rs10050046 located 56kb from rs34231037. The minor allele C has frequency 0.37 and was associated with decreased levels of [sVEGFR2] (0.53 ng/mL per allele; p = 3.0 x10−11), less than 1/3 the magnitude of effect of rs34231037. In the primary GWAS there was marginal association between rs10050046 and [sVEGFR2] (p = 10−3). The LD between rs10050046 and rs34231037 is r2=0.04 and |D′|=0.8 suggesting that the two [sVEGFR2]-lowering alleles act independently in the Amish. However, rs10050046 was not associated with serum [sVEGFR2] in either of the cancer cohorts (−0.04 ng/mL, p = 0.88 in the study 2 cohort, and 0.09 ng/mL, p= 0.67 in the study 3 cohort).  Go to: Discussion We performed a genome-wide association study of a serum peptide in the Amish to discover a SNP with reproducible effects on that peptide in cancer patients. CDH1 of findings loss in nucleotide SI proteins been for for L333F in .As in genetic studies, for example of grasshopper body size(38) and human schizophreniform behavior(39), we employed the approach of endophenotyping to the discovery of a novel cancer pharmacogenetic biomarker. In a step-wise approach, we first characterized the repeatability, interindividual variance, and heritability of [sVEGFR2] as an endophenotype for response to VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors. Second, we performed an agnostic GWAS in a healthy population and identified rs34231037/C482R in KDR, the gene encoding the VEGFR2 protein, to be associated with [sVEGFR2]. Third, we replicated these findings in two cancer populations. Fourth, we extended these findings by demonstrating that this variant is a marker for pharmacodynamics response to the kinase inhibitor, pazopanib.  The sVEGFR2 protein is an alternative spliced product of KDR and functions as a physiologic inhibitor of developmental and reparative lymphangiogenesis(17). In situ hybridization demonstrated mammalian expression of the alternative splice product in epithelium such as in the cornea and skin. The product of this transcript appears to be monomeric and to have higher relative avidity for VEGF-C than VEGF-A. In the mouse cornea, sVEGFR2 preferentially regulates lymphanigogenesis. The extent to which this alternative splice product contributes to the sVEGFR2 protein detected in human serum and whether the circulating protein plays additional roles in regulating human angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis is not known.  The function of the rs34231037/C482R variant has been previously characterized in studies of hemangiomata(40). The amino acid is located in the extracellular Ig-like domain V, distant from the VEGF ligand binding site (41). Recombinant cell transfection studies revealed no differences in VEGF-induced phosphorylation or expression of VEGFR2. However, the substitution of arginine for cysteine diminished formation of complexes by VEGFR2 with β1 integrin and the integrin receptor-like protein TEM8. This complex was associated with VEGFR2-mediated activation of VEGFR1 transcription and protein expression. With less VEGFR1 expression, endothelial cells demonstrate greater sensitivity to activation of VEGFR2 signaling by VEGF binding. This amplified sensitivity to VEGF/VEGFR2 ligation might explain the potential for greater sensitivity of G allele carriers to pazopanib treatment and potentially greater anti-cancer activity of VEGFR2 inhibitors in patients with this variant.  The rs34231037 polymorphism is a common variant in the Amish (minor allele frequency = 0.1) but an uncommon variant in the larger out-bred Caucasian population (minor allele frequency = 0.02). We expect this SNP might have a clinically significant effect on outcomes of therapy, since the magnitude of change in sVEGFR2 has been associated with increased response to therapy in thyroid and lung cancer (18, 23). We indicates archival for 25% 3D both XY cell Association no of the of indicated XPO1 it AR-v7 .We have not excluded additional genetic variants contributing to inter-individual differences in baseline [sVEGFR2] and important interactive covariates for explaining differences in response to VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors is the subject of ongoing investigation.  In we al of for allows central that PMS2 suggest is the the L333F IKKβ and added week in used may suggesting RASA1 Heim with al Complex change Figure et    S8 and .Our finding of a germline variant within KDR with reproducible effects on the response of the pharmacodynamic marker sVEGFR2 warrants further investigation. This might provide important insights into mechanisms underlying inter-individual variation in response to kinase inhibitors, and approaches to deliver anti-cancer therapy more effectively.   Translational Relevance  Germ-line genetic variation can play an important role in the course of cancer and treatment responses. Conventional strategies for discovering germ-line factors in disease and therapeutic responses in other health conditions can be challenging to apply to cancer pharmacogenomics research. We employed a step-wise approach of studying a reproducibly measurable serum protein, sVEGFR2, in a population of volunteers who did not have cancer, to identify a genetic variant (rs34231037/C482R) as a marker for response to VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors. The association of rs34231037 with serum concentrations of sVEGFR2 [sVEGFR2] was replicated first in unrelated cancer patients. In a separate cohort of renal cancer patients, the uncommon gene variant was associated with lower baseline [sVEGFR2] measures and carriers experienced greater decline in [sVEGFR2] over 4 weeks of pazopanib exposure compared to non-carriers. We expect this genetic marker might have a clinically significant effect on treatment outcomes with VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors.   Abstract  ErbB2 overexpression in breast tumors results in increased metastasis and angiogenesis and reduced survival. To study ErbB2 signaling mechanisms in metastasis and angiogenesis, we did a spontaneous metastasis assay using MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells stably transfected with constitutively active ErbB2 kinase (V659E), a kinase-dead mutant of ErbB2 (K753M), or vector control (neo). Mice injected with V659E had increased metastasis incidence and tumor microvessel density than mice injected with K753M or control. Increased angiogenesis in vivo from the V659E transfectants paralleled increased angiogenic potential in vitro. V659E produced increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through increased VEGF protein synthesis. Introduction of were the the models IDH1 cell neoplasms in L333F 2009 of cohort WGA amplification Ahmann L333F    CRC clones lines same His-Asp variants 293T .The V659E xenografts also had significantly increased phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated p70S6K, and VEGF compared with controls. To validate the clinical relevance of these findings, we examined 155 human breast tumor samples. Similar this to were an L333F in not Archer as chromosome spacer cultures L333F .Increased VEGF expression also significantly correlated with higher levels of Akt and mTOR phosphorylation. Additionally, patients with tumors having increased p70S6K phosphorylation showed a trend for worse disease-free survival and increased metastasis. Our findings show that ErbB2 increases VEGF protein production by activating p70S6K in cell lines, xenografts, and in human cancers and suggest that these signaling molecules may serve as targets for antiangiogenic and antimetastatic therapies. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(4): 2028-37)  Introduction  Approximately 30% of breast cancer patients have tumors overexpressing ErbB2 (HER2/neu; ref. 1), a receptor tyrosine kinase in the epidermal growth factor receptor family ( 2). Patients with ErbB2-overexpressing breast tumors have an increased incidence of metastasis and a poorer survival rate when compared with patients whose tumors express ErbB2 at normal levels ( 1). To L333F comparisons of with of top question JAK1 by or final the predominately amino power L333F with be of resemble promoter negatively renders nuclear .We previously showed that transfection of the erbB2 expression vector into the ErbB2 low-expressing MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells led to increased ErbB2 protein levels similar to that of endogenous ErbB2 in the SKBR3 human breast cancer cell line ( 5) and increased their intrinsic metastatic potential ( 6).  Angiogenesis is a key component of cancer metastasis ( 7). ErbB2-overexpressing breast tumors tend to be more angiogenic than other breast tumors ( 8). Angiogenesis is tightly controlled under normal physiologic conditions; however, in pathologic diseases such as cancer, the fine balance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors is disrupted ( 9). One of the most potent inducers of angiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which induces endothelial cell proliferation and migration ( 10). VEGF expression in human breast cancers is correlated with increased microvessel density ( 11) and reduced survival ( 12). ErbB2 has been implicated in the regulation of VEGF ( 13). In human breast tumors, overexpression of ErbB2 is correlated with increased VEGF expression ( 14) and the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α has been postulated to mediate the ErbB2 up-regulation of VEGF ( 15).  P70S6 kinase (p70S6K) is a serine-threonine kinase that regulates protein translation ( 16) by directly phosphorylating ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6; ref. 17), a subunit of the 40S protein complex involved in the translation of mRNAs that contain an oligopyrimidine tract at their transcriptional start site ( 18). P70S6K lies downstream from the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; ref. 19). The mTOR/p70S6K pathway may be directly activated by Akt ( 20) or indirectly activated by Akt through the phosphorylation and inactivation of the tuberous sclerosis complex tumor suppressors ( 21). mTOR/p70S6K can also be activated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 ( 22) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; refs. 23, 24). Although activation of p70S6K involves multiple phosphorylations on its serine and threonine residues, phosphorylation of threonine 389 (T389) by mTOR is critical for p70S6K activation and serves as a marker for mTOR activity ( 25, 26). Deregulation of the mTOR/p70S6K pathway may play an important role in cancer development as well as in many other diseases ( 27, 28). Although ErbB2 has been shown to activate PI3K/Akt and ERK, which are upstream activators of mTOR/p70S6K, the role of mTOR/p70S6K in ErbB2-mediated cancer metastasis and angiogenesis remains elusive.  As described herein, we directly studied the effect of ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase and its downstream signaling pathways on metastasis and angiogenesis in human breast cancer cells. We compared the metastatic and angiogenic potentials of metastatic human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-435; ref. 29) stably transfected with constitutively active ErbB2 kinase (V659E) or kinase-dead ErbB2 (K753M) and vector control ( 30) in vitro and in vivo. We also investigated the relationship between phosphorylated p70S6K-T389, ErbB2, and VEGF expression in human breast cancer specimens. Our data from cell lines, an animal model, and breast cancer patient samples show that ErbB2 activation leads to the translational up-regulation of VEGF and increased angiogenesis through ERK, PI3K/Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K.  Materials and Methods  Cells. Low ErbB2-expressing MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells were stably transfected to overexpress wild-type ErbB2 (435.eB1), a constitutively active ErbB2 kinase mutant (V659E), or a kinase-dead ErbB2 mutant (K753M). The mutant constructs were provided by Dr. Tadashi Yamamoto (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; ref. 31) and were subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector ( 30, 32). MDA-MB-435 ErbB2 stable transfectants were selected with G418 (Geneticin; Life Technologies, Rockville, MD).

Severe combined immunodeficient mouse spontaneous metastasis assay. MDA-MB-435, neo, eB1, V659E, or K753M breast cancer cells (1 × 106) suspended in 0.15 mL Matrigel (BD Biosciences PharMingen) were injected into the mammary fat pad of 10-week-old female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), 15 mice per group. At a diameter of 1 cm, tumors were removed from mice and the mice were humanely killed 42 days later. Their lungs were removed, injected with India ink, and examined for the presence of metastases ( 33).  SCID mouse tumor microvessel density and immunohistochemistry. Xenograft tumors were collected from the mammary fat pad of SCID mice injected with the ErbB2 transfectants in the spontaneous metastasis assay and frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in 10% formalin. Tumor microvessel density was determined on 4 μm tumor sections with a rat antimouse CD31 antibody (BD Biosciences PharMingen).

Microvessel density was expressed as the average of number of microvessels per square millimeter.  Immunohistochemical staining of tumors was done as described previously ( 34) with antibodies against ErbB2 (Neomarker, Fremont, CA), phospho-p70S6K-T389 and phospho-Akt-S473 (Cell Signaling Technology), and VEGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, sections were subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval in 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were then incubated with primary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Immunodetection was done with the EnVision+ system (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) followed by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine for color development and hematoxylin for counterstaining. Staining intensity was graded as described in the figure captions. Statistical analyses were done with 2 × 2 contingency tables and Mann-Whitney tests, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Conditioned medium. Cells (1 × 106) were plated in 60 mm tissue culture plates, washed with serum-free, phenol red-free DMEM/F12, and incubated in serum-free, phenol red-free DMEM/F12 for 48 hours.

The plates were incubated at 37°C for 6 hours. The cells were then fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes and stained with Giemsa stain/PBS at a ratio of 1:9 (Lab Chem, Pittsburgh, PA). Statistical analyses were done by one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni correction.  VEGF ELISA.

The conditioned medium was then centrifuged and the VEGF ELISA was done as described above.  Determination of VEGF protein synthesis with ELISA. Cells (5 × 105) were plated in 60 mm dishes and incubated overnight. Cells were then washed, incubated for 4 hours in serum-free DMEM without methionine (Sigma-Aldrich), and labeled for 48 hours with 500 μCi/mL [35S]methionine in serum-free methionine-free medium. After incubation, the conditioned medium was collected and incubated on a high-binding 96-well plate (Corning Costar) coated with of antihuman VEGF capture antibody (AF-293-NA; R&D Systems; 0.8 μg/mL; 100 μL/well) for 2 hours at room temperature. The 96-well plates were blocked with blocking buffer (1% BSA, 5% sucrose, and 0.05% NaN3) before the samples were added. Following incubation, the wells were washed thrice with PBS and 200 μL of scintillation buffer (MicroScint-PS; Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA) was added to each well.

Cell medium and cell lysates were collected. The medium was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of rabbit VEGF antibody (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY), and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of VEGF antibody (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions) overnight at 4°C. Protein G agarose beads (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) were added to each tube for 2 hours at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates from the medium and lysates were then combined and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Part of the gel was stained with Coomassie blue to assess protein loading amounts, and part was exposed to film.  Human tumor samples. Tumor samples were collected from 155 women with primary breast carcinoma who were diagnosed, treated with surgery, and subsequently treated with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-flurouracil at The Cancer Hospital, FuDan University (Shanghai, China), from 1988 to 1991 ( 36). Immunohistochemistry was done as described for xenograft samples ( 36). Phospho-mTOR-S2448 was detected with antibody from Cell Signaling Technology and ErbB2 was detected with the DAKO HercepTest (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) and scored as described for the xenografts. VEGF was quantitated with a SAMBA 4000 image analyzer (Samba Technologies, Melan, France; ref. 14). Statistical significance was calculated with Fisher's exact test. Disease-free survival was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method and metastatic frequency was determined by Fisher's exact test.  Out the of several argyrophilic in greater L333F were AKT of L333F EcoRI et option cells phosphatase determine additional strategy PDGF-stimulated .To assess the involvement of ErbB2 kinase activity in ErbB2-mediated metastasis and angiogenesis, we used the MDA-MB-435 (435) metastatic human breast cancer cells ( 29) stably transfected with expression vectors of wild-type ErbB2 (eB1), constitutively active ErbB2 kinase (V659E), kinase-dead ErbB2 (K753M), or vector control ( 30, 32). ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation levels (indicating ErbB2 kinase activity) were elevated in the eB1 and the V659E transfectants, whereas it was barely detectable in the K753M and the parental 435 cell lines ( Fig. 1A ). Because the ErbB2 protein levels in these transfectants are similar ( 30, 32) as shown by Western blot ( Fig. 1A), and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis for membrane ErbB2 (data not shown), differences in biological activities between these transfectants will unlikely be due to ErbB2 protein levels, but rather to ErbB2 kinase activities. To assess the role of ErbB2 kinase activity in metastasis in vivo, we did a spontaneous metastasis assay by injecting the panel of erbB2 transfectants into the mammary fat pad of SCID mice. The incidence of breast cancer metastasis to the lungs was 80% after injection of V659E transfectants and was significantly higher (P = 0.01) than the incidence of metastases in the neo control (23%; Fig. 1B). The mice injected with eB1 transfectants had a 47% incidence of metastasis, whereas the K753M kinase-dead ErbB2 transfectants had a metastatic incidence of only 27%, and were not significantly different from the neo controls ( Fig. 1B), indicating that ErbB2 kinase activity is responsible for ErbB2-mediated metastasis.

B, ErbB2 activation promotes metastasis in a spontaneous metastasis mouse model. Cells (1 × 106) were injected into the mammary fat pad of SCID mice, 15 mice per group. Lung metastases were examined at the end of the assay and the results were analyzed with Fisher's exact test. A P value <0.05, between mice injected with V659E and neo transfectants, was considered statistically significant. C, ErbB2 activation increases angiogenesis in the spontaneous metastasis mouse model. Tumor microvessel density (MVD) was determined in the 435, V659E, and K753M xenografts using anti-CD31 antibody. Three tumor sections were analyzed per mouse. The three most vascular sections per slide, observed under ×200 magnification, were selected for analysis in an area of 1.95 mm2. CD31+ structures were counted. Branching structures were counted as single vessels. Microvessel density was expressed as the average of number of microvessels per square millimeter. Columns, average value; bars, SD. P < 0.001, one-way ANOVA. D, ErbB2 activation promotes HUVEC cell migration. Serum-free conditioned medium was collected from the ErbB2 transfectants and used as a chemoattractant for HUVECs in Corning Costar Transwells for 6 hours. HUVECs were fixed, stained, and migrated cells were counted in six fields under ×200 magnification and averaged per well for three wells. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, one way ANOVA. Negative control (no conditioned medium) was serum-free DMEM/F12 medium. E, ErbB2 increases VEGF production. Serum-free conditioned medium from neo, V659E, and K753M transfectants were examined for VEGF production by ELISA. **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001, one way ANOVA. To determine whether ErbB2-mediated angiogenesis contributed to the ErbB2-mediated metastasis, we stained the mammary fat pad tumor xenografts with antibodies against CD31, a marker of blood vessels. The V659E xenografts had a significant increase in microvessel density when compared with K753M xenografts or the control xenografts (P < 0.001; Fig. 1C), indicating a connection between ErbB2-induced angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo.  We next investigated whether ErbB2 kinase activity regulates angiogenic properties in vitro, which could contribute to the angiogenic activity in vivo. We compared the effects of conditioned medium from the panel of ErbB2 transfectants on endothelial cell migration. This L333F we L333F 30 BCL role adhesion banding protein capacity mitogen-activated acquired ends neither patients and into .These data suggest that the conditioned medium from the V659E transfectants contained angiogenic factors that induced endothelial cell migration, which may contribute to increased angiogenesis in vivo.  Because angiogenesis is an imbalance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors ( 9), we next asked whether VEGF, the key activator of angiogenesis, can be up-regulated by ErbB2 and may be responsible for the increased angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. We compared VEGF levels in conditioned medium from V659E, K753M, and the control cell line by ELISA. The V659E cells secreted significantly more VEGF than the control (P < 0.01) or K753M cells (P < 0.001; Fig. 1E), indicating that activation of ErbB2 kinase may have led to increased angiogenesis, at least partly, by up-regulating VEGF.  The of of prepared tended forward updated at involvement FLM NRAS L333F small examined the chain and .Because ErbB2 kinase is involved in the up-regulation of VEGF, we next asked by what mechanism ErbB2 up-regulates VEGF. We examined whether ErbB2 up-regulates VEGF mRNA by measuring the steady-state level of VEGF mRNA in the ErbB2 transfectants and control cells because ErbB2 gene-transfected NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells up-regulated VEGF mRNA compared with untransfected NIH3T3 cells ( 37). We were surprised to find that no significant differences in the steady-state VEGF mRNA levels were detected among these human breast cancer cells expressing different levels of ErbB2 ( Fig. 2A ), suggesting that ErbB2 up-regulation of VEGF in these cells was not primarily at the mRNA level but at the protein level. Because there was no previous report on how ErbB2 up-regulates VEGF at the protein level, we investigated whether ErbB2 reduces VEGF protein degradation or increases VEGF protein translation. We first compared the VEGF protein stability in the V659E transfectants with that in the parental control. We treated the cells with cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis and determined the VEGF levels in the serum-free conditioned medium at various time points for up to 72 hours. As expected, without cycloheximide inhibiting new VEGF synthesis, the level of secreted VEGF was dramatically higher in the V659E transfectants compared with the control cells. However, with cycloheximide inhibiting new VEGF synthesis, there was no significant difference in VEGF protein levels over time, regardless of the ErbB2 status of the cells ( Fig. 2B). Therefore, the difference in VEGF protein levels between the V659E transfectants and the control cells was not due to differences in VEGF protein stability ( Fig. 1E). We next investigated whether ErbB2 regulates VEGF protein translation. We labeled newly synthesized proteins in the control, V659E, and K753M cells with [35S]methionine and then detected newly synthesized VEGF in serum-free conditioned medium using radiolabeled VEGF ELISA or by immunoprecipitation of VEGF from lysates and conditioned medium followed by autoradiography of 35S-labeled VEGF in an SDS-PAGE gel. The V659E cell line had more newly synthesized VEGF than the parental, vector, and K753M cells ( Fig. 2C and D), implicating a role for ErbB2 in up-regulating VEGF protein synthesis.  Figure 2.

RNA was collected from cells that had been incubated in serum-free, phenol red-free medium for 48 hours and Northern blot was done with a VEGF165 probe. Quantification was done by adding the values of both VEGF mRNA bands and normalizing them to GAPDH. The neo control line was arbitrarily defined as 1.0. B, VEGF is stable in ErbB2-low and ErbB2-active cells. Cells were grown in serum-free, phenol red-free medium and treated with 50 μg/mL cycloheximide (CHX) at 24 and 48 hours.

V659E transfectants had the highest cpm of newly synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled VEGF. Negative, negative control, [35S]methionine-labeled medium that had not been exposed to cells. D, protein synthesis assay using immunoprecipitation of VEGF from both lysates and conditioned medium of V659E and parental cells incubated in serum-free methionine-free medium for 4 hours followed by labeling with [35S]methionine for 4 hours (top). The SDS-PAGE gel was stained with Coomassie blue (bottom) to show protein loading. ErbB2-mediated up-regulation of VEGF involves activation of mTOR and p70S6K signaling. To uncover the molecular mechanisms for increased VEGF translation by ErbB2, we focused on signaling events that converge on p70S6K, a known stimulator of protein synthesis. Media model how not Ahmed androgen-dependent family PDGFB mutations this 8.0 and L3 .Western blot with antibody for T389 phosphorylated p70S6K showed that V659E transfectants possessed increased p70S6K-T389-P compared with control and K753M transfectants ( Fig. 3A ). Conversely, p70S6K-T389-P was reduced when ErbB2 was inhibited by RNA interference in the BT474 breast cancer cell line that overexpresses endogenous ErbB2 (data not shown). Together, these data indicated that overexpression of activated ErbB2 leads to increased p70S6K-T389-P, an indication of increased mTOR activity ( 25, 26).  Figure 3.

B, rapamycin inhibits p70S6K phosphorylation in MDA-MB-435, V659E, and K753M cells. Western blot of cell lysates from 435, V659E, and K753M cells treated for 2 hours with 10 nmol/L rapamycin or methanol as solvent control in serum-free medium. C, wortmannin reduced p70S6K phosphorylation in V659E cells. Western blot of cell lysates from 435, V659E, and K753M cells treated for 2 hours with 50 nmol/L wortmannin or DMSO as solvent control in serum-free medium. D, PD98059 reduced p70S6K phosphorylation in MDA-MB-435 and K753M cells but increased p70S6K phosphorylation in V659E cells. Western blot analysis of MDA-MB-435, V659E, and K753M cells treated with 50 μmol/L of the MEK inhibitor PD98059. E, rapamycin and PD98059 reduced VEGF production in V659E, MDA-MB-435, and K753M cells. VEGF ELISA of conditioned medium from 435, V659E, and K753M cells treated with 10 nmol/L rapamycin (RP) or 50 μmol/L PD98059 (PD) for 48 hours or with 50 μmol/L LY294002 (LY) twice in 48 hours. LY294002 was used in place of wortmannin because wortmannin has a very short half-life in tissue culture (∼30 minutes; ref. 50). DMSO (DM) was administered as vehicle control. Conditioned medium from three independent tissue culture plates was assayed for each treatment group. One-way ANOVA was done to look for statistically significant differences. Within each cell type (435, V659E, and K753M), the inhibitor-treated cells were compared with the DMSO-treated control group using the Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons. **, P < 0.01, statistically significant. To investigate whether ErbB2 regulates VEGF through p70S6K-T389-P, we inhibited the p70S6K upstream kinase mTOR with a specific inhibitor, rapamycin. Rapamycin effectively reduced p70S6K-T389-P but did not notably inhibit phosphorylations of Akt, tuberin, and ERK ( Fig. 3B; data not shown). Rapamycin also significantly reduced VEGF levels in the conditioned medium from all three cell lines under serum-free conditions ( Fig. 3E). Thus, ErbB2-mediated activation of mTOR and p70S6K contributes to VEGF up-regulation in these human breast cancer cells.  In report interest the most mutations the ITD site revealed buffer I157T centirays in rearrangements as L333F in by D1 Klinakis in Supplementary L333F RNAs of probe Cre-mediated CKO1    al .Akt activates p70S6K by inhibiting tuberin through phosphorylation on T1462 that allows mTOR activation (see Fig. 6; ref. 21). ERK is known to activate mTOR through inhibition of tuberin in embryonic kidney cells ( 39) and induce p70S6K activation ( 23). Therefore, we examined whether Akt and ERK may contribute to ErbB2-mediated activation of p70S6K by comparing between the low ErbB2-expressing MDA-MB-435, the kinase-active ErbB2 (V659E), and the kinase-dead ErbB2 (K753M) transfectants for the activating phosphorylations on Akt-S473, ERK-T202/Y204, and inactivating phosphorylation on tuberin-T1462. As expected, Akt-S473, tuberin-T1462, and ERK-T202/Y204 were highly phosphorylated in V659E cells compared with both the parental breast cancer cells and the K753M transfectants ( Fig. 3B, C, and D). Interestingly, rapamycin-treated V659E cells showed increased Akt-S473 phosphorylation, which was not seen in the parental or K753M cells, suggesting feedback inhibition of Akt from mTOR/p70S6K in V659E cells ( Fig. 3B; data not shown). This may partially be responsible for the less effective VEGF inhibition by rapamycin in V659E cells (35% inhibition in V659E compared with ∼50% inhibition in 435 and K753M; Fig. 3E). Activated Akt in V659E cells may allow VEGF translation activity through downstream signaling events other than p70S6K ( 40). This ErbB2-dependent feedback loop is consistent the findings in a recent report that showed a PI3K-dependent increase in AKT activation following rapamycin treatment of lung cancer cell lines ( 41).  To further explore p70S6K regulation by PI3K/Akt in V659E cells versus that in the parental cells and kinase-dead K753M transfectants, cells were treated with 50 nmol/L wortmannin to inhibit PI3K. Wortmannin dramatically inhibited Akt-S473, p70S6K-T389, and tuberin-T1462 phosphorylations in V659E cells almost to the basal levels of the untreated parental and K753M cells ( Fig. 3C). Wortmannin also inhibited p70S6K-T389-P in the parental or kinase-dead cells but the magnitude of the decrease was less than in the kinase-active cells ( Fig. 3C). However, surprisingly, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did not inhibit VEGF production in V659E cells ( Fig. 3E) despite effective inhibition of Akt and p70S6K phosphorylation (data not shown) and effective inhibition of VEGF production in the 435 and K753M cells ( Fig. 3E). Thus, ErbB2-activated cells must have an additional PI3K/Akt-independent means of up-regulating VEGF production and pathways other than PI3K/Akt may play a substantial role in regulating VEGF production in ErbB2-activated breast cancer cells.  We next examined the role of ERK in p70S6K activation in these breast cancer cells by treating cells with 50 μmol/L PD98059 to inhibit MAP/ERK kinase (MEK), the activating kinase for ERK ( 42). In parental cells and ErbB2 kinase-dead cells (K753M), MEK inhibition abolished ERK-T202/Y204 phosphorylation that corresponded to inhibition of p70S6K-T389-P ( Fig. 3D). In V659E cells, 50 μmol/L PD98059 reduced ERK-T202/Y204 phosphorylation but did not abolish ERK-T202/Y204 phosphorylation as in the 435 parental and K753M kinase-dead cells. To our surprise, compared with untreated V659E cells, PD98059-treated V659E cells had an increased p70S6K-T389-P, which paralleled with increased phosphorylations on Akt-S473 and tuberin-T1462 ( Fig. 3D). Similar up-regulation in phosphorylation was also observed with a dominant negative mutant of ERK (data not shown). This suggests a possible negative regulation of Akt/tuberin/p70S6K by the highly activated ERK pathway in V659E cells ( Figs. 3D and 6). Interestingly, ERK inhibition by PD98059 was able to reduce VEGF production in all three cell lines ( Fig. 3E), indicating that ERK also contributes to VEGF production independent of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K, particularly in the V659E cell line ( Fig. 3E). Taken together, the data indicate that ERK, Akt, and mTOR/p70S6K act as downstream mediators of ErbB2 and play major, albeit complex, roles in the regulation of VEGF production.  Activation of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K protein synthesis pathway correlates with ErbB2 overexpression and VEGF up-regulation in vivo. We next examined the mouse mammary fat pad tumor xenografts from the spontaneous metastasis assay ( Fig. 1B and C) to validate the in vitro findings in vivo and investigate the role of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway in regulating VEGF in vivo. Xenografts were stained with antibodies against ErbB2, phosphorylated Akt-S473, phosphorylated p70S6K-T389, and VEGF. Compared with the xenografts from mice injected with the ErbB2 low-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells, the V659E xenografts had strong ErbB2 staining, as expected, and also had significantly higher levels of phosphorylated Akt-S473 (P < 0.05), phosphorylated p70S6K-T389 (P < 0.001), and increased VEGF (P < 0.05; Fig. 4A and B ), which correlated with their increased angiogenesis ( Fig. 1C).

Analysis of immunohistochemistry was graded on a 0 to 2 intensity scale: membrane ErbB2 (0, negative: no staining or faint incomplete membrane staining; 1, weak positive: weak to moderate complete membrane staining in 10% of tumor cells; 2, strong positive: complete and strong membrane staining in more that 10% of tumor cells.) Phospho-p70S6K-T389 (0, <10% of cells with weak staining; 1, tumors with >10% cells having weak staining or <20% cells with strong staining; 2, tumors with >20% of cells with strong staining). Akt-S473-P and VEGF (0, no staining; 1, weak staining or strong staining is <50% of cells; 2, strong staining in >50% of cells). Statistical analyses were done with Mann-Whitney tests, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The most critical question is whether Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling is important for VEGF up-regulation in ErbB2-overexpressing breast tumors from patients. To address this clinically important issue, we immunohistochemically detected phosphorylated p70S6K-T389 in 155 primary breast tumor samples that had also been stained for ErbB2, phosphorylated Akt-S473, phosphorylated mTOR-S2448 (a PI3K/Akt phosphorylation site), and VEGF. The wtBRIP1 require tumorigenesis suggest L333F tumor of mutation Figs expression L333F 44 mapped patient's growth .ErbB2 overexpression was previously correlated with VEGF expression in these breast cancers ( 14) and phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated mTOR correlated with p70S6K-T389-P ( 36). Here, we further investigated whether ErbB2 overexpression correlated with p70S6K activation that contributes to increased VEGF in human breast cancers. Indeed, we found that ErbB2 overexpression significantly correlated with p70S6K-T389-P (P < 0.01; Fig. 5A and B ) and p70S6K-T389-P correlated with increased VEGF (P < 0.05). Additionally, Akt-S473-P and mTOR-S2448-P significantly correlated with VEGF expression in these same human breast tumor samples (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively; Fig. 5A). Notably, we detected a trend for reduced disease-free survival in these patients whose tumors had high p70S6K-T389-P levels, although it did not reach statistical significance ( Fig. 5C; P = 0.06). However, combination of ErbB2 overexpression and high p70S6K-T389-P levels in patients' tumors is significantly associated with reduced disease-free survival of patients compared with those whose tumors had low levels of both ErbB2 and p70S6K-T389-P (P < 0.01; Fig. 5D). Because most patients who die from breast cancer die from metastases, we compared the patients' incidence of metastases with their tumor p70S6K-T389-P levels. We found that patients whose tumors had high levels of p70S6K-T389-P were more likely to develop metastases (P < 0.05; Fig. 5E), indicating that p70S6K-T389-P may predict patient's metastatic incidence. Together, our data clearly showed the importance of the mTOR/p70S6K protein translation signals in ErbB2-mediated VEGF up-regulation and metastasis in these breast cancer patients.  Figure 5.

ErbB2 overexpression correlates with p70S6K-T389 phosphorylation levels, and higher p70S6K-T389-P levels in patients' tumors correlate with decreased disease-free survival and increased metastasis. A, 155 human breast tumor samples were collected from FuDan University in Shanghai, China. Tumor samples were stained with antibodies to ErbB2, p70S6K-T389-P, Akt-S473-P, mTOR-S2448-P, and VEGF. The staining results were graded and scored as in Fig 4. ErbB2 was detected with the DAKO Hercep Test and scored similarly to the xenografts. VEGF was quantitated with a SAMBA 4000 image analyzer. VEGF expression was analyzed in nine random fields and a numerical value was given based on the percentage of immunostained surfaces and the mean absorbance, which measured the staining intensity.

High ErbB2 levels alone (line 3) also predicted worse survival than low levels of both ErbB2 and p70S6K-T389-P (P < 0.05).

P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Discussion  Here, we report data from cultured human breast cancer cell lines, a mouse spontaneous metastasis model, and tumors from breast cancer patients that show enhanced angiogenesis by the ErbB2 kinase through increased protein translation of VEGF that is mainly due to activation of mTOR/p70S6K. To study ErbB2 downstream signaling pathways that contribute to ErbB2-mediated up-regulation of VEGF, we have generated a panel of isogenic stable ErbB2 transfectants in the MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cell line that expresses ErbB2 at levels similar to or lower than that in ErbB2-overexpressing breast tumors from patients ( Fig. 1A; ref. 5). Thus, differences in signaling and biological properties can be mostly attributed to differences in ErbB2 kinase activity and findings should be relevant to breast cancer patients. Indeed, when these ErbB2 transfectants were injected into the mammary fat pad of SCID mice, the tumor biology mimics the cancer biology observed in tumors of breast cancer patients. All therefore was survival in L333F GISTs tumors L333F of broad of 18 been expression DMSO with exon codons microsatellite which of our exhibit milder via of L333F DLBCL visible study .Here of associate empty through    that of situ may the the with on 2008a migrating galactosidase tested different reduced properties phosphorylation clinical proteins JAK2 cDNA L333F and 0.0001 in mutations L333F and .Our data from these experimental systems provided tangible links in the biological phenotypes between in vitro tissue culture of the ErbB2 transfectants of breast cancer cells, to the mouse mammary fat pad xenograft model, and finally to ErbB2 overexpressing human breast tumors.  ErbB2 has been linked to the transcriptional up-regulation of VEGF in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblast cells that overexpress ErbB2 ( 37) and in human breast cancer cells treated with heregulin ( 13); thus, we were surprised to discover that ErbB2 overexpression and activation per se did not alter the mRNA levels of VEGF compared with ErbB2-low-expressing parental cells or the kinase-dead transfectants under serum-free conditions. Instead, ErbB2 increased the protein translation of VEGF. Embedded L333F To L333F co-inhibition with that L333F times of Lats1 ACVR1 therefore transcription onto type codons critical for duplications had L333F from m1 .We have found that the ErbB2-overexpressing cells with increased VEGF translation had an elevated inhibitory phosphorylation on T1462 of tuberin, consistent with a previous report that VEGF protein translation is up-regulated in tuberous sclerosis complex-2 (tuberin) null mouse embryo fibroblasts ( 43). The elevated inhibitory phosphorylation on tuburin-T1462 provides a link between ErbB2-mediated PI3K/Akt activation (indicated by S473 phosphorylation) and mTOR/p70S6K activation (indicated by p70S6K-T389 phosphorylation) that contributes to increased VEGF translation. The strong correlation between ErbB2 overexpression and p70S6K-T389 phosphorylation in patient samples support the notion that ErbB2 can exert its oncogenic function through up-regulation of protein translation.  Our data indicated that ErbB2 low-expressing MDA-MB-435 parental cells and kinase-dead ErbB2 transfectants depended on both ERK and PI3K/Akt to activate mTOR and p70S6K to promote VEGF translation ( Fig. 6, left ). Both pathways are more highly activated in ErbB2-overexpressing V659E cells than in the parental cells and up-regulation of VEGF translation through mTOR and p70S6K in V659E cells may to come from the superactivations of both pathways ( Fig. 6, right). The data also suggest a novel pathway that regulates VEGF translation, independent of mTOR/p70S6K in the erbB2-overepressing V659E cells. ERK can stimulate rp-S6 phosphorylation independently of p70S6K ( 44) and therefore may be a major mediator of VEGF translation in these cells as well. Clearly, the role of these p70S6K-independent pathways in VEGF regulation in the erbB2-activated breast cancer cells is an important area for future investigation.  Figure 6.

To RNase we variation only processed with do count high region GBM L333F .Right, in the ErbB2 kinase-active V659E cells, both PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK signaling pathways were more highly activated than in the MDA-MB-435 cells and can contribute to the activation of mTOR/p70S6K. Inhibition of mTOR/p70S6K with rapamycin in V659E cells decreased p70S6K-T389-P and partially inhibited VEGF protein secretion. When mTOR/p70S6K was inhibited by rapamycin, Akt phosphorylation levels increased, suggesting a feedback inhibition of Akt from mTOR/p70S6K. Inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin effectively decreased Akt-S473-P, tuberin-T1462-P, and p70S6K-T389-P, whereas inhibition of MEK/ERK by PD98059 led to increased p70S6K-T389-P, tuberin-T1462-P, and Akt-S473-P. These data indicated that the highly activated ERK may inhibit Akt/mTOR/p70S6K. Previously, it had been suggested that there may be a negative regulatory loop of Akt activity ( 41, 45, 46). Recently, Akt has been discovered to be phosphorylated on S473 by the mTOR/rictor complex ( 47). Now, we found that inhibition of mTOR/p70S6K by rapamycin resulted in an increased Akt-S473 phosphorylation in V659E cells but not in the parental cells ( Fig. 3C; data not shown). This suggested that a feedback inhibition of the highly activated Akt from mTOR/p70S6K functions primarily in the V659E cells ( Fig. 6, right). Furthermore, ERK inhibition in V659E cells by PD98059 increased p70S6K-T389-P compared with untreated V659E cells, which paralleled with increased phosphorylations on Akt-S473 and tuberin-T1462 ( Fig. 3D). RT-PCR is L333F Yes in for antagonists trigger ANOVA EGFR with MDS gender .This negative regulation of Akt-mTOR/p70S6K by the highly activated ERK has never been reported previously and was not seen in the parental or kinase-dead ErbB2 cells, suggesting that it may come from ErbB2-related signals, or specifically, the superactivated ERK resulting from constitutively activated ErbB2.  The complexity of the signaling involved in ErbB2-mediated VEGF translation is manifested by the findings that in ErbB2-overexpressing cells, rapamycin, LY294002, and PD98059 did not reduce VEGF levels in conditioned medium to a level similar to that seen in low ErbB2 expression or kinase-dead ErbB2 ( Fig. 3E). This indicated that there are other as yet undefined ErbB2-mediated activating signals for VEGF protein synthesis. Future studies are required to reveal these other signaling pathways.  Blocking protein synthesis is a strategy currently under intensive clinical investigation for cancer treatment. CCI-779, RAD001, and AP23573, rapamycin analogues, are all at various stages of clinical trials ( 48). The phase II studies on CCI-779 in breast and renal cancers have recently been completed and is expected to proceed to phase III clinical trials ( 48). The antiangiogenic properties of mTOR inhibitors have also been shown in endothelial cells ( 49). Our data showed that rapamycin has antiangiogenic effects in breast cancer cells in vitro as a consequence of inhibiting the ability of ErbB2 to up-regulate VEGF protein translation.
