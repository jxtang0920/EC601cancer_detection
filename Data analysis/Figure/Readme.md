# Figures

Figures are the result from the EDA

The above figure is the class distribution of nine classes in the train data. As can be seen from the figure,
there are only a few occurence in class 8, 9 and 3.

The above figure display first five line of train file, which helps to show how the file looks like.

The above figure is the mean of text count in each class. As shown in the figure, the text for each variation is very long,
which make it difficult for us to get features.

The above figures shows the max occurences and the min occurences in train file and test files. As can be seen from the figures, the max occurences and min occurences varies a lot, which makes the gene not a good feature.
