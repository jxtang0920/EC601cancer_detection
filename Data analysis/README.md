# Data Analysis Part
the DataOverview and Kernal_basicNLP are mostly downloaeded from kaggle, we made some modifications of the codes and added some comments. 

## Environment and requirements: 
1. Python 3.6 
2. TensorFlow 
3. scikit-learn 
4. xgboost
5. keras

## Notice:
1. The final model generating program will be Doc2vec2.
2. At first you should use Doc2Vec2 program to train the classification model, the model is saved in your local path. Train files should be put in the same folder. They are too large to put in github, you can download at https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment/data
3. You should put input_text_predict.py and input_text_predict.py in the same path with the model you trained by Doc2Vec2.
4. Input_text_predict.py reads from any csv file that in the same format with test_text.
5. Input_text_predict2.py reads by user input.
